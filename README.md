## Product Display Page

This is a simple web page which is created using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript plus jQuery.

It shows a list of products with their price, units in stock and delivery date and an image of the product. Also, it displays ‘Out of Stock’ image for the case when the product isn’t available.

The structure of the page consists of a section representing the list itself with each item being represented by an <article> element. Within that article element we have the title(h3 element),  image preview and a <ul> containing the details regarding each product. Further description you can see in the comments within the code.

As a future development:
* I can use the Telerik components.
* Dynamically load the images instead of the static way I use now.
